DeployMint is a staging and deployment system for WordPress MU.
Unzip the archive into your wordpress plugin directory and activate 
the plugin on any blog in your WordPress MU Network.

Visit the options page and configure a data directory that is outside of your
document root. Make sure your web server has write access to that directory.

Check that all other options are configured correctly.

Create a new project. Then visit the project menu that will appear
under the DeployMint main menu. 

Take a snapshot of your live blog and deploy it to a staging or development blog.

Make any changes on staging/dev that you would like, snapshot the changes
and deploy them to live.
